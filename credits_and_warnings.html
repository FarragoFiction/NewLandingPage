  ITEM: ZampaLand Florida infinite staircase

DESCRIPTION: An infinite staircase to be placed between the rollercoaster 'Truth Express' and the lamia's bathroom. It will play a constant noise of static as visitors try to climb their way up. The staircase can be easily exited by going down, but visitors who exit the infinite staircase will not be granted a free coupon for a SpiralShake.

[AUDIO FILE ATTACHED: The voice of cartoon character Dr. Robotnik saying 'Get that damn Lamia!']

[ARCHITECTURAL PLAN ATTACHED: This depicts a staircase powered by a rapidly-moving series of Quotidians holding stair steps. Once the visitor goes far enough up the stairs, the Quotidians 1. Begin moving each step to match the speed of the visitor, while a designated Audio Quotidian mimics perfectly the voice of Dr. Robotnik from Sonic The Hedgehog.

REVIEW: Unlawful under clause 3.4, page 54 of the Humans for Handmade Horrors act. Yes, the legal battle is ongoing, but I do not recommend using an 'audio quotidian' until the court decides if they fall under freelance impression work or copyright infringement software. Either way the impression would put us in bad water.

RECOMMENDATION: Ms. Devona (noting a lack of last name) recommends these could be done by human operators at ZampaLand's expense. You would need to take all precautions for them to not suffer the fatality rate of the conditions imposed on Quotidians. She further comments (noting, with no approval from her attorney) that hiring mute workers 'would help with increasing diversity in the workplace' and 'would be less likely to try and call for help'. 

FURTHER COMMENT: Ms. Wanda, without prejudice: this is a labor-expensive lamia obsession trap, utilizing a lot of manpower for little gain. Noting how the last four have yet to work, in my recommendation, it would be best to save the legal fees and scrap this project.

PROJECT STATUS: Approved by Management, with modification.

[End of statement.]

    <h1>Zampanio Credits and Warnings!</h1>
    <h2>Zampanio Warning!</h2>
    <i>Obsession is a dangerous thing. Zampanio needs you to live a long life. Take breaks, hydrate, and make sure you
      stay in balance.</i>
    <p>ZampanioSimulator is a fanmade browser simulation of a game called "Zampanio", from this weird <a target='_blank'
        href="http://knucklessux.com/PuzzleBox/Secrets/ZampanioFAQ/">creepypasta FAQ </a>I found. (NOTE: it was lost
      media for a while but at least i found the printout of the START of the arg I got obseseed with in 2020 but not
      the parts that had a lot of what stuck with me)</p>

    <p>Given I'm trying to be true to what appears to be for all intents and purposes a creepy pasta, there's going to
      be themes that might not be for everybody in here! Without giving away the premise, here's a broad list of content
      warnings, though a good rule of thumb is that if you're a fan of Zampanio you're probably gonna be okay with this
      weird fan work I made of it. </p>

    <p>ALSO! The whole point of Zampanio, simulated or otherwise is the customized experience so don't blame me if you
      don't get any of these, or get an especially potent dose or something.</p>

    <p>Finally, Wastes Honor: no jump scares or anything lame and cheap like that. Honestly if you stay on your path and
      don't be a dick to Zampanio, it'll be perfectly nice to you.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Themes of Unreality</li>
      <li>Creepy sounds/Ambiance</li>
      <li>Unsettling Images</li>
      <li>Unsettling Videos</li>
      <li>Violent, Creepy Monsters Described in Text</li>
      <li>Player Blaming</li>
      <li>Player Insulting</li>
      <li>Rabbitholes of Obession</li>
      <li>Addiction Themes</li>
      <li>AI generated content<ul>
          <li>(both AIs I've made generating content (its kind of my thing) and other people's AI giving us their spin
            on Zampanio)</li>
          <li>(in particular the <a target="_blank"
              href='http://knucklessux.com/PuzzleBox/Secrets/QuotidianQuorom/Guides/QuotidianQuorom%20Survival%20Strategy.pdf'>Quotidians</a>
            ARE biological generative AIs, so any content they're 'responsible for' uses that kinda stuff just to be
            sufficiently canon (a human mind would only get it wrong). eyedolgames.com in general is considered to be
            Quotidian territory, though they infiltrated the <a target="_blank"
              href='http://farragofiction.com/CatalystsBathroomSim/NORTH/EAST/SOUTH/NORTH/NORTH/SOUTH/SOUTH/EAST/bathroom'>Bathroom</a>
            last year so. Be warned.</li>
          <li>oh right and theres a Quotidian stealing my voice out there. and ab's voice. maybe even Truths? its
            probably fine. </li>
            <li>Oh and Jaimie is a Quotidian. They speak a bit in the South, you know, the one that's a train? All words Jaimie has ever said, even in the RP they're originally from (they were my intern) is me trying to convince AI dungeon to stop pretending to be a game and instead pretend to be my intern. Good times.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Strong Langauge (Sorry, that's all me, Zampanio itself is probably not so sweary)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If I've missed anything I should have had in the warnings, feel free to message me at jadedResearcher at gmail,
      yeah?</p>
    <p>At the end of the day my goal is to create my art while keeping everything in good fun. If you find yourself
      being damaged by Zampanio (whether my branch or someone elses) take a break yeah? Or even decide that Zampanio
      sucks and you're done with it! Its definitely not for everybody and I promise you're not disappointing anyone if
      you gotta back off. <br><br><br>Stay safe out there.</p>
    <h2>
      Zampanio Credits
    </h2>
    <p>Specific pages will have specific credits as appropriate.</p>
    <p>In general, all writing, music, sound effects, coding, images and videos were created by me (JR) or IC (tends to
      write blorbo ficlets, draw art of blorbos and make banging tunes), unless sacrificed to my branch of Zampanio by
      someone else.</p>
    <p>I work hard to credit those who Sacrifice, but some of the Observers, Unmarked and even Marked occasionally want
      to avoid the spotlight and choose various placeholders instead (such as 'a friend') or even want me to just not
      highlight their stuff as separate.</p>
    <p>If you think I've failed to credit you, let me know and I'll see what I can do. Be warned though, once something
      is Sacrificed to Zampanio even I might not be able to find it again, and it certainly can not be UNSacrificed.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I hope this is obvious, but I don't own the concept of "Zampanio" and if you find just random
      Zampanio content in the wild and its not on a domain I seem to own... thats not my stuff? Could have different
      content warnings or whatever.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="credits-entry">
   <h2> Other Warnings and Credit:</h2>
    <p>Anything I made before getting obsessed with Zampanio probably doesn't need any content warnings?</p>
    <p>Basically anything you could find <a target='_blank' href='http://farragofiction.com/Staging/'>here</a> or <a target="_blank" href='http://farragofiction.com/Staging/past.html'>here</a>.</p>
    <p>Back then I was just a jaded researcher... no recursion, justified or otherwise lol :) :) ;)</p>
    <p>Credits will be in specific things but the first 'here' I had a whole group of people helping me and the second 'here' was just me alone.</p>
